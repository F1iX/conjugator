## Framework to conjugate Spanish verbs for learning purposes

Being tired of learning grammar with pen and paper just right before the next exam, I started to write this Android app as a fun way to memorize the structure of Spanish grammar.

Feel free to fork the app as a framework to learn the grammar yourself without having to think too much about the programming part.

Since this is one of my first apps, I would love to receive your feedback and learn how I can improve in terms of data structures, software layout and UI design!
